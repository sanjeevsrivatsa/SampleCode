This program, given a set of fragments (ASCII strings), reassembles the document from which they came. It searches through the collection of fragments and finds the two fragments with the biggest overlap, and then combines them. It continues this process until the original document is reassembled. The test cases are found in test_cases.txt. Each test case is on its own line and the fragments are separated by commas. Written for a programming challenge.
